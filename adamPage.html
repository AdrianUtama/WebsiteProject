			Golfer Adam Scott was born in Adelaide, Australia, in 1980.
			The son of golfers, Scott began playing the game at the age of 4 and, for most of his childhood,
			was coached by his father, Phil. He turned pro in 2000 and, over the next decade,
			became one of the game's best players. In 2013, Scott became the first Australian to win the Masters Tournament.

			Born in San Diego, California, in 1970, Phil Mickelson began golfing as a child,
			running away from home to the golf course at age 3. His career began in earnest when he was at Arizona State
			where he won three NCAA individual championships and became only the second collegiate golfer to earn
			1st team All-American honors all four years. Mickelson turned professional at the age of 22 and is now one of the
			sport's highest-paid players, boasting more than 40 career wins by 2013, including three Masters titles.
